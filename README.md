# QA-Ecommerce-Testing-Project
End-to-End Manual, Automation and API Testing of E-Commerce Login Module


## Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end Quality Assurance testing of an E-Commerce application's Login module. The objective is to validate functionality, error handling, backend responses, and automation stability.

The project includes:
- Manual Testing  
- Automation Testing using Selenium with Java  
- API Testing using Postman  
- Defect Reporting and Validation  

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Manual Testing: Test Plan, Test Cases, Bug Reports  
- Automation: Selenium WebDriver with Java  
- API Testing: Postman  
- Browser: Google Chrome  
- Version Control: GitHub  

## Project Structure
01_Test_Plan -> Test planning document
02_Test_Cases -> Login module test cases
03_Bug_Reports -> Logged defects with severity & priority
04_Automation -> Selenium automation scripts (Positive & Negative login)
05_API_Testing -> Postman API collection
Screenshots -> Execution and validation evidence

## Testing Scope

### Manual Testing
- Created Test Plan and Test Cases  
- Executed positive and negative scenarios  
- Logged defects with Severity and Priority  

### Automation Testing (Selenium + Java)
- Automated valid login scenario  
- Automated invalid login scenario  
- Added validation (assertions)  
- Captured execution proof  

### API Testing (Postman)
- GET API validation (200 OK)  
- POST API validation with valid credentials  
- Negative API testing with invalid inputs  
- Saved Postman collection  

## Unique Value of This Project
This project integrates:
- Manual, Automation, and API testing  
- Positive and negative test coverage  
- Validation using assertions  
- Defect-based risk thinking and automation prioritization  

This demonstrates complete QA lifecycle understanding, not just tool usage.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of SDLC and STLC  
- Hands-on Selenium automation  
- API request and response validation  
- Practical defect management approach
